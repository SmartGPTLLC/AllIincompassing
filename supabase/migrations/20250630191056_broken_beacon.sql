  # Fix Ambiguous Client ID in Storage Policies

  1. Changes
     - Fix ambiguous 'client_id' column reference in storage policies for client-documents bucket
     - Explicitly qualify column references in RLS policies
     - Update policies for client document uploads to use proper table references
