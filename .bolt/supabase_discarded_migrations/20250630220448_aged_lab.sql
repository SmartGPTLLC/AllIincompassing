/*
  # Fix Storage Policies for Client and Therapist Documents
  
  1. Changes
     - Drops existing problematic policies
     - Creates new policies with correct syntax (removing IF NOT EXISTS)
     - Fixes typo in policy names (therapis â†’ therapist)
     - Adds proper bucket policies for client and therapist documents
  
  2. Security
     - Maintains role-based access control
     - Ensures clients can only access their own documents
     - Ensures therapists can only access documents for their clients
     - Admins retain full access
